# UAV–UGV Disaster-Area Network Simulation (ROS2)

A modular **ROS2-based simulation framework** for studying **UAV ad-hoc networks**, **UGV charging policies**, **coverage planning**, **routing**, and **environment-dependent behaviour** in disaster scenarios.

The system simulates:

* A **backbone** of *cluster-head UAVs (CH)*
* **Member UAVs** connected to CHs
* A **UGV** acting as a mobile charging station
* A **sink gateway** representing the “Internet”
* **Mobile phone users**
* A **weather environment** affecting UAV power consumption
* A **network monitor** collecting metrics
* A **coverage planner** generating deployment & routing
* A **visualizer** showing CH, member, sink, and UGV positions

This repository is designed for **research experiments**, especially on charging scheduling, routing strategies, connectivity robustness, and battery/weather interactions.

## ✨ Key Features (Implemented so far)

### ✔ Multi-role UAV simulation

Each UAV runs its own `uav_node` instance with:

* **Roles:**

  * `role=1` → Cluster Head (CH)
  * `role=0` → Member UAV
* **Battery model** with temperature-dependent drain
* **Weather subscription** (temperature affects power usage)
* **Traffic generation** (if enabled)
* **Hop-by-hop routing** through CH backbone
* **Charging request logic**
* **Charging session execution**
* **Failure detection** (battery dead event)

### ✔ UGV Charger with multiple scheduling policies

`ugv_charger_node` supports:

* FCFS
* Role-priority (CH > member)
* EDF (earliest battery depletion first)
* Dynamic weighted scoring
* Network-based *charge decision delivery* using control packets

The UGV tracks UAV status, queues requests, assigns slots, and emulates charging.

### ✔ Coverage Planner (deployment + routing)

`coverage_planner_node`:

* Randomly generates **sink** and **UGV** positions inside the area
* Places CHs on a **grid layout** (or later hex layout)
* Assigns member UAVs to nearest CH
* Computes **CH backbone connectivity graph**
* Runs **Dijkstra from sink** to compute `next_hop_to_sink`
* Publishes `UavDeployment` messages with:

  * Position
  * Role
  * Cluster ID
  * CH ID
  * Next hop information

### ✔ Traffic forwarding framework

Fully working multi-hop routing:

* Member UAV → its CH
* CH → next CH → … → sink
* CH used as routing hubs
* Supports control traffic (charging decisions)

### ✔ Network Monitor

`network_monitor_node` computes:

* Packet generation count
* Packet delivery count
* End-to-end delay
* Average delay
* Charging request timestamps
* Charging wait times
* Charging session counts
* Battery death count & timestamps

Useful for experiments & performance comparison.

### ✔ Planner Visualization (2D GUI)

Python `planner_viz_node` dynamically displays:

* CH UAVs (red + dashed coverage circles)
* Member UAVs (green)
* Sink (blue)
* UGV (yellow)
* Auto-updates positions on every deployment message

### ✔ Sink Gateway Node

Handles:

* Delivery of packets addressed to the sink
* Publishing `/network/traffic_delivered` for monitoring
* Listening to deployment updates for visualization

### ✔ Weather Server

Publishes `WeatherStatus` (temperature, etc.).
UAVs use temperature to scale energy consumption via a piecewise function.

### ✔ User Device Simulator

Simulates mobile phones generating traffic into the UAV network.

# 🚀 How It Works (Data Flow)

### 1. **Coverage Planner starts first**

* Generates positions for CHs, members, sink and UGV
* Computes Dijkstra routing for CH→sink
* Publishes `UavDeployment` for each UAV and UGV

### 2. **UAVs receive deployment**

Each UAV updates:

* Position
* Role
* Cluster
* CH assignment
* `next_hop_to_sink` (for CHs)

### 3. **Weather server influences UAV battery drain**

UAV battery consumption = base × weather factor.

### 4. **Traffic flows**

Member → CH → CH → … → Sink

### 5. **Charging requests**

If battery < threshold:

* UAV sends `CHARGE_REQUEST` as a control packet (routed via backbone)
* UGV evaluates queue and sends `CHARGE_DECISION`
* UAV travels into charging state

### 6. **Network monitor gathers statistics**

Per-packet and per-session metrics.
